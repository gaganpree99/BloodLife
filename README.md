# Read Me for Assignment 4: Gaganpreet Singh (B00819217)

From the 2 features I had selected in Assignment 3, i.e. Report Managemnet and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's), I have selected to implement the latter.

# Frequently Asked Question (FAQ's)
Apart from a list of Frequently asked questions, a user will has an option to send the query to the organisation. 
The user gets a unique token ID for his submitted query on the website. Also, a confirmation email for the submitted query is sent to the user.
The organisation can then reply to the user over email.

## GitLab Repository

The code for FAQ webpage can be access through [GitLab branch A4_Singh_Gaganpreet](https://git.cs.dal.ca/mahagaokar/Group14_TechGoons/tree/A4_Singh_Gaganpreet).

Further, since we have merged the code base of all the team members, the website can be checked at [Gitlab master branch](https://git.cs.dal.ca/mahagaokar/Group14_TechGoons/tree/master)
 
## Libraries/Toolkits Used
 1. **Bootstrap**
    Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for HTML, CSS, and JS development. I have used this toolkit to add responsiveness to the webpages.

 2. **Jquery**
    Jquery is a lightweight Javascript language. It helps in HTML/DOM, CSS manipulation and HTML event methods. 

 3. **Ajax**
    Ajax is a collection of web development methods for creating asynchronous web applications using many client-side web technologies.

 4. **Spring Boot Framework**
    The Spring Framework is a framework for implementation and reversal of the Java platform control container.
