							<ul>
								<div>
									<h5>
										<li>How much blood are you taking with every donation?</li>
									</h5>
									<p>During a single blood donation, we obtain about 450 ml (a pint) of blood.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>
										<li>How long will it take my body to replace the blood
											that's taken?</li>
									</h5>
									<p>The plasma portion of your donation is replaced within
										hours and the platelet portion within days. Red blood cells
										can take months to replenish.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>
										<li>How long after donating blood should I avoid
											strenuous activity?</li>
									</h5>
									<p>You should avoid strenuous activity for six to eight
										hours after giving blood.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>
										<li>For someone to be a 'universal' donor, what blood
											type must he/she have?</li>
									</h5>

									<p>People with O negative (O-) blood are considered
										universal donors because anyone can receive O- blood. But all
										blood types are needed to meet the needs of patients for blood
										and blood products.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>
										<li>I am currently taking medication. Can I still give
											blood?</li>
									</h5>
									<p>If you want to know whether a particular medication
										might keep you from being eligible to donate, you can call us
										at 1&nbsp;888&nbsp;2&nbsp;DONATE (1-888-236-6283). You can
										still give blood when taking certain medications: in many
										cases, it isn't the medicine but rather the reason for taking
										it that may be of concern.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>
										<li>Why are the questions asked during the screening
											process so personal?</li>
									</h5>
									<p>The screening process is lengthy and may seem intrusive,
										but it is absolutely necessary to safeguard the blood supply
										by screening out people who are at greater risk of
										transmitting infections through their blood. The criteria we
										use to determine donor eligibility are based on scientific
										knowledge of risk factors. All our screening measures meet
										stringent regulatory requirements and accepted worldwide blood
										service standards.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>
										<li>If you test all donated blood, is screening even
											necessary?</li>
									</h5>
									<p>While we test every donation using sophisticated and
										reliable procedures, these tests are not perfect. There are
										brief periods after infection called ‘window periods’ when
										current tests cannot detect signs of a virus. Advances in
										testing technology have reduced but not eliminated these
										window periods. This is why we have strict screening
										procedures to ensure each donor poses the least possible risk
										of transmitting diseases through his or her blood.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>
										<li>I donate blood regularly and my answers to the
											screening questions are always the same. Do I have to answer
											every time I donate?</li>
									</h5>
									<p>Because a lot can happen between donations, we are
										required to treat every donation as a separate event. For the
										safety of the blood supply and potential blood recipients, we
										have to take maximum caution and ask the questions every time.</p>
								</div>
								<div>

									<h5>
										<li>I am a healthy teenager. Why do I have to wait until
											I'm 17 before I donate?</li>
									</h5>
									<p>
										Current medical information tells us that 17 is the earliest
										age at which it is safe to give blood. But there are other
										ways you can help if you want to get involved with Canadian
										Blood Services before you turn 17. Find out how to become a
										volunteer or organize a high-school blood clinic by emailing
										us at <a href="mailto:feedback@blood.ca">feedback@blood.ca</a>
										or calling 1&nbsp;888&nbsp;2&nbsp;DONATE (1-888-236-6283).
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>
										<li>May I bring children with me when I come to donate?</li>
									</h5>
									<p>
										Please plan to have a friend or family member who is not
										donating with you if you bring children under 10 years of age.
										Children under 10 and their supervisor are welcome to wait in
										the refreshment area and enjoy a snack while they wait for
										their hero/donor. We ask that children in our clinics be
										supervised by a person who is at least 12 years of age.<br>
										<br> Children aged 10 and older are welcome to wait in
										the refreshment or designated waiting areas without
										supervision.<br> <br> Please ensure those joining
										you are comfortable being in an environment where blood is
										collected.
